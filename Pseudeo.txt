How To Play War

Give each of the two players 26 cards in a pile face down



	At the same each player will flip over the card that is on the top of their deck:
	Who ever has the hightest card takes both card and places them at the bottom of their deck:

IF each player's card are equal to each other than
	:each player will pull three cards from their deck face down and flip over the third card 
	who ever has the highest third card takes all the card pulled out from the decks on that round
	If third card is equal to each other repeat until some one has a higher card
If both players run out of cards at the same time 
	:then the game ends in a tie
If a person runs out of cards when they are supposed to play a card when tied	
	:the other player wins the game
 
	
Who ever gets all the cards in their deck wins the game
